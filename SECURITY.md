# Security Policy

At Yolov5ForCSGO, the security of our users' data and systems is of utmost importance. To ensure the safety and security of our open-source projects, we have implemented several measures to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Snyk Scanning

We use Snyk to regularly scan all repositories for vulnerabilities and security issues. Our goal is to identify and remediate any potential threats as soon as possible, to minimize any risks to our users.

## GitHub CodeQL Scanning

In addition to our Snyk scans, we also use GitHub's CodeQL scans to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities across Yolov5ForCSGO repositories.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you suspect or discover a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report directly in Issues.
